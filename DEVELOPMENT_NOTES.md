# Development Notes

## Architecture Decisions
- Chose autograd for automatic differentiation over manual gradients
- Implemented modular design for easy extension and testing
- Used type hints throughout for better code maintainability

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-class logistic regression support
- Regularization (L1/L2) implementation  
- Advanced optimization algorithms (Adam, RMSprop)
- GPU acceleration with CuPy
- Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks for optimization validation
- Edge case testing for robust error handling
